The first thing I need to mention here is that I didn't keep track of nearly the amount of things I should have through these first few weeks. I'm pretty certain I have undiagnosed ADHD (I'll check that out soon) and keeping centralized and concise notes of processes is not exactly my strong suit. For instance, I jotted a mental note to write down the process of setting up a Mural website once I got home after class, but pushed that back when something came up, and by the time I was ready to actually type it out, I drew a blank. I don't have any tangible Unessay work just yet, either, it's mainly been literal brainstorming with no notes, but that'll definitely change by the next interstitial.

Setting up the tracery bot was relative painless once I got past a single issue. I got the error code and didn't quite understand what was wrong, but after a few minutes of fiddling around I realized I was missing a single square bracket, and then it worked great. Setting up the Mural website was mainly a repetitive trial and error process where I failed multiple times due to a single file being hidden in the zip and I repeatedly failed to import it with the rest of the files, so the website obviously didn't run. Screenshots of the failures are in the ephemera.
